rusty-sandbox is, obviously, a sandboxing library for Rust that's not [gaol].

It's based on a simple model where you can do the following in the sandbox:

- any normal computation (not I/O)
- I/O operations on *existing* file descriptors (i.e. files and sockets opened before entering the sandbox)
- accepting connections on an *existing* socket (which creates new file descriptors)
- opening files under pre-selected directories *though the Sandbox/SandboxContext API* (which creates new file descriptors)

All other ways of creating new file descriptors will fail in the sandbox!
As well as other potentially dangerous interactions with the outside world such as sysctls, process signals (kill), etc. (platform dependent).

## Underlying technology

rusty-sandbox strongly prefers simple sandboxing facilities that don't require any persistent and/or user-visible records (such as [chroot directories and bind mounts like gaol does on Linux](https://github.com/servo/gaol/blob/9d3753d6f6fb4b4d0f3cb5a29287db44659984fd/platform/linux/namespace.rs)).

- FreeBSD: [Capsicum], the first supported sandbox.
- OpenBSD: **TODO** [pledge]
- Apple OS X: **TODO** [Seatbelt]
- Linux: **TODO** oh fuck. This is going to involve seccomp-bpf. Unfortunately, the openat O_BENEATH behavior proposed on [capsicum-linux](http://capsicum-linux.org) hasn't been accepted into the Linux kernel!

## Usage

You can sandbox the current process:

```rust
extern crate rusty_sandbox;
use std::fs;
use std::io::Read;
use rusty_sandbox::Sandbox;

fn main() {
    let mut file = fs::File::open("README.md").unwrap();
    Sandbox::new().sandbox_this_process();
    let mut buf = Vec::new();
    file.read_to_end(&mut buf).unwrap();
    println!("Read file: {}", String::from_utf8_lossy(&buf));
    fs::File::open("README.md").expect("But can't open!");
    // on FreeBSD:
    // thread '<main>' panicked at 'But can't open!: Error { repr: Os { code: 94, message: "Not permitted in capability mode" } }', src/libcore/result.rs:760
}
```

And here's a forked process reading files from allowed directories and communicating with the parent process:

```rust
extern crate rusty_sandbox;
use std::io::{self, Read, Write};
use rusty_sandbox::Sandbox;

fn main() {
    let mut pipe = Sandbox::new()
        .add_directory("repo", ".")
        .sandboxed_fork(|ctx, pipe| {
            // This closure runs in a forked sandboxed process!
            // Let's open a file under the "repo" directory
            // and write it to the pipe that communicates
            // with the parent process...
            let mut file = ctx.directory("repo").unwrap()
                .open_options().open("README.md").unwrap();
                // yes, this is an OpenOptions API!
            io::copy(&mut file, pipe);
            // In a real program, you can do any RPC you want
            // over this pipe. Just don't .wait() early.
        }).expect("Could not start the sandboxed process")
        .wait().expect("Sandboxed process finished unsuccessfully")
        .pipe;
    let mut buf = Vec::new();
    pipe.read_to_end(&mut buf).unwrap();
    println!("From the sandboxed process: {}", String::from_utf8_lossy(&buf));
}
```

Of course, you can use the directories feature when sandboxing the current process too:

```rust
extern crate rusty_sandbox;
use std::io::Read;
use rusty_sandbox::Sandbox;

fn main() {
    let ctx = Sandbox::new()
        .add_directory("repo", ".")
        .sandbox_this_process();
    let mut file = ctx.directory("repo").unwrap()
        .open_options().open("README.md").unwrap();
    let mut buf = Vec::new();
    file.read_to_end(&mut buf).unwrap();
    println!("Read file: {}", String::from_utf8_lossy(&buf));
}
```

Fun fact: [an early prototype of this library](https://gist.github.com/myfreeweb/9c13c245e9f4051236dd) used a shared memory arena for communicating between processes, like [the sandbox for the config parser in sandblast](https://github.com/myfreeweb/sandblast/blob/7dba442af2778ed7ee6a7b303ee709f015ea45fc/config.c#L181). Turns out it's not practical in any language that's higher level than C, because you can't just tell the language's standard library to allocate on an arena.
